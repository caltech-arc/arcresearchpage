Repository history: 
  - Pulled forward Daniel's code from his repository: https://github.com/danineamati/arcresearchpage. 
  - Wrote .py file: 'CSV_JSON_converter.py'. Converts responses downloaded from the Google form as file in directory 'FacultyResponses.csv'. There's also a facultyformat.py but this converts for individual faculty members rather than producing the entire JSON file.
  - 'divisionDatabase.json': JSON from 2021-2022 responses
  - 'divisionDatabase2020.json': JSON from 2020-2021 responses
